              I built this android application during my undergraduation. The app was based on the idea of tackling different phobias using
              Virtual Reality. I used Unity3D, C# and Google VR SDK to build this.
            </p>
            <p className="card-text" style = {{color: 'white'}}>
              You actually need a bluetooth controller to walk around in the virtual environment. I didn't have it while recording this video.
              So I tap my phone screen ferociously to walk around <span role="img" aria-label = "face with stuck-out tongue and tightly closed eyes">üòù</span>.
